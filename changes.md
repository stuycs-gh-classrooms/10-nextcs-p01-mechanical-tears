```

Projectiles class(we forgot)
Program speed(60 fps)
Projectiles Types:
- Stronger aliens = more damage to shields/player(maybe)
- Player may also have a different gun


Shields(Maybe Added?)
- We saw that one group made a shield out of "bricks" (individual objects)
- Our current Shield: Takes a certain amount of hits before ALL of it disappears

Starting screen
Easter eggs
Customize aliens and players

Difficulty(Maybe)
- Ours will already get harder the more you kill

Power-Ups:
- orbs(or any other shape) will fall down. Player picks them up and gains a random and temporary boost
  - Damage, Movement speed, projectile speed/firerate

As waves increase the aliens get more hp or become faster?
