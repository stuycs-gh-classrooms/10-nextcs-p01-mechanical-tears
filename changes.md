Projectiles class(we forgot)
Program speed(60 fps)
Projectiles Types:
- Stronger aliens = more damage to shields/player(maybe)
- Player may also have a different gun


Shields(Maybe Added?)
- We saw that one group made a shield out of "bricks" (individual objects)
- Our current Shield: Takes a certain amount of hits before ALL of it disappears

Starting screen
Easter eggs
Customize aliens and players

Difficulty(Maybe)
- Ours will already get harder the more you kill

Power-Ups:
- orbs(or any other shape) will fall down. Player picks them up and gains a random and temporary boost
  - Damage, Movement speed, projectile speed/firerate

As waves increase the aliens get more hp or become faster?

Aliens:
- depending on the hits left needed to defeat an alien, the alien will be different colors
  - ex. if a 3-hit alien was already hit twice, it would be the same color as a 1-hit alien

SPECIAL SPECIAL FEATURES(Original Idea by US!!!!):
- Inspired by bullet hell games we were thinking of making lasers that cover the map (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OspSOSPjOuI ) (timestamp 1:53)
- Like in the video there will be a warning indictator telling the player to move before the actual projectile spawns in
- Prevents camping and makes the game funner
- This requires another class and more time so we might only do this if we have enough time left over
- Class will be called worldEvents

- Another thing we will 100% add is music
